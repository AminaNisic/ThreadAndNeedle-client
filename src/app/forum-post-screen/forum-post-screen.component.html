          <p style="color: darkGreen; margin: 0 5.12rem;">Hello! I am a beginner  to sewing.<br> 
            I am currently working on sewing a summer dress. But I have a few issues.
            I am not sure which fabric I should choose. I know that with some types of fabric it is rather difficult to work, so I would love it if you suggested some which are easy to use for novice. This fabric should aso be breathable and light.  Also, I would really appreciate it if you gave me some ideas for the shape, or even better a pattern that is easy to follow.  I also want to know if there are any particular colours that go well with summer dresses. I still don't feel very sure in my sense of style, so any advice would be greatly welcomed. The thought of hemming the dress once I've finished making it makes me feel a little apprehensive. Do you have any hemming advice or techniques to make the job simpler?
            Finally, I would be very grateful if you could suggest any additional advice or information for a novice sewer like me. Any help or direction would be helpful as I'm eager to learn and develop my talents.
            I appreciate all of your help in advance.

          <p class="text-white dark:text-white">Hi Sarah!<br> 
            If you do not have much experience with sewing, I would recommend starting with simple A-line dress!
            As for fabrics, I would recommend cotton since it is simple to work with as well as pretty breathable. 
            Alternative to that could be a light linen material, since it is not hard to work with. When it comes to hemming, 
            I think that blind or rolled hem might be the easiest to start with. You have plenty of good tutorials on this 
            website for that, so you should look at those. 
            I wish you all the luck, and remember to not get too frustrated if you mess up!

            I started sewing a few months ago, and I want to tell you that you will get hang of it soon! Do not get unmotivated.
            For the design, I think it is the best to use simple colour fabric - pastels might be the best summer option. When it comes to choosing fabrics, I agree with Janeâ€™s answer. Cotton and linen are the easiest breathable options. For the pattern, you can find many tutorials on the blog page of Thread and Needle. Just search for beginner friendly tutorials. 
            
            I hope this was helpful and I cannot wait to see your designs in the future.
